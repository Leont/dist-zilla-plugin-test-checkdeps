=head1 NAME

Dist::Zilla::Plugin::Test::CheckDeps - Check for presence of dependencies

=head1 VERSION

version 0.013

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 [Test::CheckDeps]
 fatal = 0          ; default
 level = classic

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module adds a test that assures all dependencies have been installed properly. If requested, it can bail out all testing on error.

This plugin accepts the following options:

=for stopwords TODO

=over 4

=item * C<todo_when>: a code string snippet (evaluated when the test is run)
to indicate when failing tests should be considered L<TODO|Test::More/Conditional tests>,
rather than genuine fails -- default is '0' (tests are never C<TODO>).

Other suggested values are:

    todo_when = !$ENV{AUTHOR_TESTING} && !$ENV{AUTOMATED_TESTING}
    todo_when = $^V < '5.012'   ; CPAN.pm didn't reliably read META.* before this

=item * C<fatal>: if true, C<BAIL_OUT> is called if the tests fail. Defaults
to false.

=item * C<level>: passed to C<check_dependencies> in L<Test::CheckDeps>.
(Defaults to C<classic>.)

=item * C<filename>: the name of the generated file. Defaults to
F<t/00-check-deps.t>.
